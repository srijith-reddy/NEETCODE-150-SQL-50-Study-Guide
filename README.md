# NEETCODE-150 & SQL-50 Study Guide

A personal study guide for grinding through the **NeetCode 150** Data Structures & Algorithms list and the **SQL 50** set.  
This repo is meant to organize problems and keep notes in one place.

## Contents
- Topic-wise folders for NeetCode 150
- Topic-wise folders for SQL 50
- Notes and solution attempts in Python and SQL

## How Iâ€™m Using This Repo
1. Pick a pattern/topic and work through its problems.  
2. Write solutions in Python (for DSA) or SQL.  
3. Keep short notes in each topic folder about patterns, tricks, and mistakes.  
4. Revisit solved problems after a gap to reinforce learning.  

## Goal
Finish **NeetCode 150** and **SQL 50** systematically while focusing on pattern recognition and efficient problem solving.
